# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

Local test:
npx hardhat node
delete contracts from artifacts,
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run .\scripts\deployFBTCD.js --network localhost
npx hardhat run .\scripts\frozen-btc-loop.js --network localhost

```
